OboNode Components can expose variables within the system. These can be used in text with a double curly brace syntax (for example {% raw %}`{{assessment:attemptsRemaining}}`{% endraw %}). When an OboNode Component is rendered containing recognized variables those variables will be replaced with the corresponding value.

Refer to the [OboNode Reference](../developers/#obonode--content-block-reference) for any variables available.
