## Structure Concepts

The OboXML Document structure has certain concepts that are valuable to know before you get started.

Conceptually, the document's structure follows a certain pattern looking something like this:

```
Module
  Sections
    Pages
      Chunks
```

## ObojoboDraftDoc

All OboXML documents should have a singular outer `<ObojoboDraftDoc>` element.

```xml
<ObojoboDraftDoc>
  <!-- Insert Imagination here -->
</ObojoboDraftDoc>
```

## Module Tag

> @TODO - should I just combine this with The above step? What's the point of Module? Could we just omit it?

Within our ObojoboDraftDoc, there is always a `<Module>` element.  You can define the `title` attribute for your entire module.
```xml
<ObojoboDraftDoc>
  <Module title="My Module">
  </Module>
</ObojoboDraftDoc>
```

## Content and Text

Add some text to the Content section.  A `<Content>`, `<Page>`, `<p>` (paragraph), and the text itself will be added into the Module

Notice the `<p>` paragraph tag has been adopted from standard HTML. Obojobo supports a number of regular HTML tags for text described in the [OboHTML Text Content](authors_obo_html_examples.md).

```xml
<ObojoboDraftDoc>
  <Module title="My Module">
    <Content>
      <Page>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
      </Page>
    </Content>
  </Module>
</ObojoboDraftDoc>
```

## Id Attributes

All OboNodes support an `id` attribute, though they can usually be omitted.

You'll only need to manually define an id for use in custom actions or triggers.  Below we'll add an `id` to our page so we can link to it later.

```xml
<ObojoboDraftDoc>
  <Module title="My Module">
    <Content>
      <Page id="my-special-page-1">
        <p>Hello World!</p>
      </Page>
    </Content>
  </Module>
</ObojoboDraftDoc>
```


## Navigation Menu

Obojobo will automatically generate the navigation based on content.  You can control the contents of the menu using the following values and attributes.

* [`ObojoboDraft.Pages.Page`](bo_reference.md#obojobodraftpagespage) uses the `title` attribute.
* [`H2`](authors_obo_html_examples.md#heading) uses the tag's contents.
* [`ObojoboDraft.Section.Assessment`](obo_reference.md#obojobodraftsectionsassessment) section gets a default value of "Assessment", but can be changed using the `title` attribute.

The following menu will be generated by the XML below it.  Note that the sub-page navigation items are only expanded when that page is being viewed.

```xml
<ObojoboDraftDoc>
  <Module title="My Module">

    <Content>
      <Page title="Page 1">
        <h2>H2 Title</h2>
        <p>...</p>
        <h2>Another H2 Title </h2>
        <p>...</p>
      </Page>
      <Page title="Page 2">
        <h1>H1 Title</h1>
        <h2>H2 Title</h2>
        <p>...</p>
      </Page>
    </Content>

    <Assessment>
      <Page></Page>
      <QuestionBank></QuestionBank>
    </Assessment>

  </Module>
</ObojoboDraftDoc>
```


## Short and Long Node Names

It's worth noting this article shows **short node names** in the examples.

Obojobo is built to be extended, which could potentially leading to naming conflicts.  In the rare case where one would need to avoid naming collisions, the fully qualified longer version of their names may be used.

Here's an example of the Hello World! document with fully qualified node names:

```xml
<ObojoboDraftDoc>
  <ObojoboDraft.Modules.Module title="My Module">
    <ObojoboDraft.Sections.Content>
      <ObojoboDraft.Pages.Page id="my-special-page-1">
        <p>Hello World!</p>
      </ObojoboDraft.Pages.Page>
    </ObojoboDraft.Sections.Content>
  </ObojoboDraft.Modules.Module>
</ObojoboDraftDoc>
```
