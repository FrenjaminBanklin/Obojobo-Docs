The Assessment contains one or more questions. Students start the Assessment then answer a series of questions, generated by the settings and relationship of one or more QuestionBanks. When finished they submit the Assessment and are given an Assessment Score as well as told their Highest Assessment Score. Students can attempt the Assessment multiple times depending on the Assessment options.
