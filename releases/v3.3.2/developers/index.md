## Obojobo Draft Document

An Obojobo Draft Document is a JSON data structure consisting of nested **OboNodes**.

This document is rendered by the Obojobo Draft Viewer. The **OboNodes** in the document themselves are data structures with a defined schema which describe the content and display of a portion of the document. Each OboNode is constructed according to it's related OboNode Component.
