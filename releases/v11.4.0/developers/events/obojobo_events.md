Writing this document:

This is for people who don't have the ability/time to glean this info directly from the source code.
They have a data dump csv full of events they are trying to make sense of in order to build a report.

Obojobo Events are used to announce and record actions.
They may be initiated on the server or client, and can be listened to in order to trigger other actions.
These events can be useful for research and data analysis. This document provides details about the different events.

Obojobo Event exports will have the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|-
| created_at | DateTime when the event was written to the database
| actor_time | DateTime when the event was initially created. This can differ from created_at when the event is initialized on the client.
| actor | Which user's session was active during this event
| action | Name of the event type (eg: `visit:create` or `nav:hide`)
| ip | IP address of the user's client.
| draft_id | Draft id of the document related to this event.
| draft_content_id | Draft Content Id of the specific version the document content this event is related to.
| version_number | [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) of the event itself. Properties can change as Obojobo changes.
| is_preview | Boolean indicating if this event was created during an instructor preview visit or not
| visit_id | The visit id during which this event was fired
| payload | JSON data of the actual event properties (shown in the rest of this document)

> Note: Obojobo Events cannot be used on the client in {{ 'trigger' | obo_node }} and {{ 'action' | obo_node }} nodes.

## Materia

> These events are exclusive to the Materia OboNode

### _materia:ltiLaunchWidget_

Occurs when a Materia widget is launched in the Obojobo Viewer.

<dl>
	<dt>Version</dt>
	<dd>1.0.0</dd>
</dl>

#### Payload

| Property | Description |
|-
| lisResultSourcedId | Represents a unique use of this widget in the Obojobo Module for the current visit
| resourceLinkId | Represents the unique location of this widget in the Obojobo Module in a course
| endpoint | The URL of the Materia widget (e.g. `https://materia.ucf.edu/embed/XXXXX/widget-name`)

> The `resourceLinkId` uniquely identifies a Materia widget inside an Obojobo Module inside a course. Each play of any given Materia widget will share the same `resourceLinkId`. Note that the `resourceLinkId` will remain the same between different versions of an Obojobo Module, except if the id of the Materia OboNode is changed.

> The `lisResultSourcedId` uniquely identifies the interaction of a Materia widget inside an Obojobo module and course for a given visit. Therefore this ID can be used to find similar events for a given Materia widget inside an Obojobo module for the same visit. This ID will be different for interactions for the same widget across multiple Obojobo modules as well as interactions for the same Obojobo module across different uses (as in, embedded in different courses).

### _materia:ltiPickerLaunch_

Occurs when an author selects a Materia widget to embed in the Obojobo Visual Editor.

| endpoint | The URL of the picker UI that is loaded (e.g. `https://materia.ucf.edu/lti/picker`)

### _materia:ltiScorePassback_

Occurs when Materia sends a score back via LTI. Specifically this is fired after Materia sends an LTI `replaceResultRequest` request.

> This event will not be fired in preview mode, and will only be sent for scorable widgets.

> Widgets may allow for more than one play through and may update their score multiple times, so it's possible to see multiple `materia:ltiScorePassback` events for the same Materia OboNode. A student's final highest score for a visit for a Materia node is the `score` value of the last `materia:ltiScorePassback` event for all of those events with the same `lisResultSourcedId`.

> The existence of this event does not indicate a successful replace result. Only events with `success` set to `true` should be considered successful.

<dl>
	<dt>Version</dt>
	<dd>1.0.0</dd>
</dl>

#### Payload

| Property | Description |
|-
| lisResultSourcedId | Represents a unique use of this widget in the Obojobo Module for the current visit
| resourceLinkId | Represents the unique location of this widget in the Obojobo Module in a course
| messageRefId | An internal ID generated by Materia for the corresponding replaceResultRequest request
| messageId | An internal ID generated by Obojobo for the corresponding replaceResultRequest request
| materiaHost | The URL of the instance of Materia that the score originated from (e.g. `https://materia.ucf.edu`)
| score | A number 0-100 representing the student's score of the widget
| success | Boolean - If `false` then the LTI message could not be verified. Otherwise `true`.

> The `resourceLinkId` uniquely identifies a Materia widget inside an Obojobo Module inside a course. Each play of any given Materia widget will share the same `resourceLinkId`. Note that the `resourceLinkId` will remain the same between different versions of an Obojobo Module, except if the id of the Materia OboNode is changed.

> The `lisResultSourcedId` uniquely identifies the interaction of a Materia widget inside an Obojobo module and course for a given visit. Therefore this ID can be used to find similar events for a given Materia widget inside an Obojobo module for the same visit. This ID will be different for interactions for the same widget across multiple Obojobo modules as well as interactions for the same Obojobo module across different uses (as in, embedded in different courses).
