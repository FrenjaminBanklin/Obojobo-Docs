The Assessment contains one or more questions. Students start the Assessment then answer a series of questions, generated by the settings and relationship of one or more QuestionBanks. When finished they submit the Assessment and are given an Assessment Score as well as told their Highest Assessment Score. Students can attempt the Assessment multiple times depending on the Assessment options.

### Content Values

* `scoreActions` **REQUIRED** Array<[ScoreAction](content_scoreaction.md)>: This defines one or more landing pages after the student submits their assessment attempt. Students can be sent to different pages based on their highest Assessment Score.
* `attempts` Integer or `"unlimited"` (Default: `"unlimited"`): The number of attempts allowed for this assessment. There is no limit if set to `"unlimited"`.
* `review` String (Default: `"never"`): Specifies if a full Assessment Review should be shown after an Assessment Attempt Quiz. One of `"never"`, `"always"` or `"no-attempts-remaining"`. Description of each setting:
  * `"never"`: After each Assessment Attempt Quiz students only see which questions they got correct or incorrect. Students never see their responses or the correct and incorrect answers.
  * `"always"`: After each Assessment Attempt Quiz students can see their responses and the incorrect and correct answers.
  * `"no-attempts-remaining"`: If any attempts remain then review acts equivalent to `"never"`. If no attempts remain then review acts equivalent to `"always"`. This means that students only see their responses and correct and incorrect answers once they have no attempts left.
* `rubric` [Rubric](content_rubric.md): Rules that specify how an Assessment Score is calculated from an Attempt Score

### Children

Assessment expects exactly two children in order:

1.  [**ObojoboDraft.Pages.Page**](obonode_page.md): The initial page shown when a student first navigates to the assessment. This page should contain a ObojoboDraft.Chunks.ActionButton to start the assessment.
2.  [**ObojoboDraft.Chunks.QuestionBank**](obonode_questionbank.md): A question bank that contains all the possible questions contained in the Assessment.

### Variables Registered

* `{{assessment:attemptsRemaining}}`: The number of attempts remaining or `"unlimited"` if no attempt limit is set.
* `{{assessment:attemptsAmount}}`: The total number of attempts or `"unlimited"` if no attempt limit is set.
