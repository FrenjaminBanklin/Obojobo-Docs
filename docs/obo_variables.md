Obojobo Components can expose variables within the system. These can be used in text with a double curly brace syntax (for example `{{assessment:attemptsRemaining}}`). When an Obojobo Component is rendered containing recognized variables those variables will be replaced with the corresponding value.

Refer to the Node Reference below for any variables available.
