Assessments allow you to add scored quizzes to your Obojobo modules. These scored quizzes can also communicate scores to an external system like an LMS via the LTI standard.

Assessments in Obojobo can allow a set number of attempts a student will have to take the Assessment or can be left unlimited. Question Banks allow you to change the questions chosen on each attempt so that each attempt is different. Assessment Rubric allow to grant extra credit (or penalties) and to set up more advanced scoring systems such as a pass/fail scoring system or being able to withhold a score to limit the unlocking of other sections in an external LMS until a target score is achieved. Finally, question feedback and review options allow you to let students see as much as their responses and correct answers or as little as which questions they got correct or incorrect.
