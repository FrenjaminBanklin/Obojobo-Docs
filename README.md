Doc Conventions

## Helper filters

* `{{ 'Text' | obo_node }}` should always be used when linking to obonodes.

## Voice and Language

* instead of "here, we are showing" and "you can set the attribute", use 'In the example' and 'Use the attribute to...'
* Avoid use of "currently", and "in the future"
